\item\needspace{2\baselineskip} The Sarkaria Commission's recommendations on Centre-State relations, while largely accepted, faced specific criticisms regarding their implementation and scope. Which of the following best encapsulates a significant critique of the post-Sarkaria Commission scenario?\\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), leftmargin=0.4cm, itemsep=0in]
\item The near-complete adoption of all recommendations led to an over-centralized system, diminishing state autonomy beyond what the Commission intended.
\item The Commission's proposals for fiscal federalism were fully implemented, but the states lacked the administrative capacity to effectively utilize the increased resources.
\item Despite some progress, the selective implementation of recommendations, particularly concerning the deployment of central forces in states, often bypassed the spirit of consultation and consensus advocated by the Commission.
\item The establishment of the Inter-State Council, as recommended, became defunct due to the lack of political will from both the Centre and the states to address contentious issues.
